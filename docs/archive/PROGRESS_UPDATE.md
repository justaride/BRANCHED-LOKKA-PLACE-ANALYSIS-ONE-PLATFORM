**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Session:** Analysis Selector Improvements & New Dashboard
**Progress:** 87% Complete (UX improvements & data framework!)

---

## ✅ Latest Updates (November 24, 2025)

### 🎯 Enhanced Analysis Selector (Session 8)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

Significantly improved the property analysis selector component for better visibility and user experience.

**Problem Solved:**
User feedback indicated that the analysis selection buttons were too small and difficult to see, especially for properties with multiple analyses (e.g., Sofienberggata 6).

**Changes Made:**
- **Larger heading:** text-2xl → text-3xl "Velg Stedsanalyse"
- **Informative header:** Shows "Denne eiendommen har X forskjellige analyser tilgjengelig"
- **Large selection cards:** Grid layout (2 columns desktop) with p-6 → p-8 padding
- **Visual indicators:**
  - "Analyse 1", "Analyse 2" badges
  - Large checkmark icon on selected analysis
  - Animated ping effect on active selection
  - Location icon with walking distance
- **Current selection summary:** Info box showing active analysis
- **Responsive design:** Works across all screen sizes
- **Hover effects:** Scale and shadow transitions

**Impact:**
- Much clearer for users which analyses are available
- Easier to distinguish between different analysis types
- Better accessibility and usability
- Dynamic counting (automatically shows "2 analyser", "3 analyser", etc.)

**Component:** `src/components/property/AnalyseSelector.tsx`
**Commit:** `9165578`
